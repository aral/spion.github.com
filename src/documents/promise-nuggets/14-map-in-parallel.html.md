When we want to apply the same function to every item in an array of values, 
we use `Array.map`

```js
[1,2,3,4].map(function square(x) { 
	return x * x; 
});
```

What if we want to do the same for async transforms? For example, we have an
array of item IDs and we want to get the item names.

Note: the items are large so we don't want to keep them entirely in memory.

#### Callbacks

Callback based functions don't return a value. That means we have
to use a special tool again - namely `async.map`

```js
async.map(ids, function(id, callback) {
	getFromStorage(id, function (err, res) {
		if (err) return callback(err);
		callback(null, res.name);
	})
}, function(err, results) {
	// results is an array of names
});
```

#### Promises

Promises are actual values - that means no special tools are required. We can
simply use Array.map to get an array of promises for the names, then apply the
usual tool on that array - Bluebird.all.

```js
Bluebird.all(ids.map(function(id) { 
    return getItem(id).then(function(result) { 
        return result.name;
    });
})).then(function(results) {
	// results is an array of names
})
```

## Notes

What if we can't run everything in parallel? Then [we need to cheange our code
a bit](15-map-in-series.html)

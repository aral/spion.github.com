Creating simple functions is easy

#### Callbacks

To create a callback-taking function, add a callback argument to your function.
Then you can pass the callback to another callback-taking function

```js
function readMyFile(callback) {
	fs.readFile('myfile.txt', callback); 
}
```

#### Promises

To create a promise-based function, simply return the promise as a result.

```js
function readMyFile() {
	return fs.readFileAsync('myfile.txt');
}
```

But what if you want to do additional processing? Then you'll also need to

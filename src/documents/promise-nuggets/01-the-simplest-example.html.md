Whats the main difference between callback-based functions and promise-based 
functions?

The first call the callback with the error and the result:

```js
fs.readFile(path, function(error, content) {
	// handle error or do something with content
})
```

The second return promises. We can attach two callbacks - one for the value, 
another to handle the error:

```js
fs.readFileAsync(path).done(function(content) {
	// do something with content
}, function(error) {
	// handle error
})
```

## Notes

Whats going on here? 

`fs.readFileAsync(file)` starts a file reading operation. 
That operation is not yet complete at the point when readFile returns. This 
means we can't return the file content. 

But we can still return something: we can return the reading operation itself. 
And that operation is represanted with a promise.

Its is sort of like a single-value stream:

```js
net.connect(port).on('data', function(res) { 
	doStuffWith(res); 
}).on('error', function(err) { 
	hadnleError(); 
});
```

But there are also some important differences which are going to be covered
later on.

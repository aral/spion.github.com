I hear you. Promise code doesn't look too different from regular node callbacks
or event emitters, except that you use a second callback for the error. And 
you're still not convinced that there is any benefit to using `.then()` to 
create new promises.

Okay then. Lets take things to the next level.

Using `.then()`, you can attach the callbacks later if you want.

For example `fs.readFileAsync(file)` returns a promise. That promise is a value, 
so you can put that in a var, or return it from a function:

```js
var filePromise = fs.readFile(file);
filePromise.done(function(res) { ... }, function(err) {});
```

Okay, that's still not much of an improvement. How about this then? You can 
attach more than one callback to a promise if you like:

```js
filePromise.done(function(res) { uploadData(url, res); });
filePromise.done(function(res) { saveLocal(url, res); }, function(err), {});
```

Hey, this is beginning to look more and more like streams - they too can be 
piped to multiple destinations. But unlike streams, you can attach more 
callbacks and get the value even *after* the file reading operation completes.

The promise will cache the value, and call your callback right after the next
tick. The file reading operation is always done only once - no need to repeat 
it.

This also makes it easier to switch code that was previously sync but had to
become async for some reason. 

For example: imagine that you need to get some stats about two file versions 
- like number of lines in both versions and the number of lines in their diff:

```js
var first = files[0], other = files[1];
var diffFirstOther = diff(first, other);

var firstLines = first.split('\n').length,
	otherLines = other.split('\n').length;

var diffLines = diffFirstOther.split('\n');

var result = {
	first: firstLines, 
	second: secondLines, 
	diff: diffLines
};
```

Later on, you figure out that the `diff()` function is kind of expensive in 
terms of CPU power, so you want it to run in another process. Lets see what
are your options:

#### Callbacks

You need to change the function `diff` to take a callback, and you move 
the diffLines calculation inside. So far so good:

```js
var first = files[0], other = files[1];
diff(first, other, function(err, diffFirstOther) {
	var diffLines = diffFirstOther.split('\n');
});

```

But wait, now the result needs to be inside that callback too. 

```js
var first = files[0], other = files[1];
diff(first, other, function(err, diffFirstOther) {
	var diffLines = diffFirstOther.split('\n');
	var result = {
		first: firstLines, 
		second: secondLines, 
		diff: diffLines
	};
});
var firstLines = first.split('\n').length,
	otherLines = other.split('\n').length;

```

This works but its horribly unintuitive because it looks like you're using 
the variables `firstLines` and `secondLines` before they are available. So you 
decide its best to move that calculation at the top:

```js
var first = files[0], other = files[1];
var firstLines = first.split('\n').length,
	otherLines = other.split('\n').length;

diff(first, other, function(err, diffFirstOther) {
	var diffLines = diffFirstOther.split('\n');
	var result = {
		first: firstLines, 
		second: secondLines, 
		diff: diffLines
	};
});
```

#### Promises

With promises our code can stay almost exactly the same. No reordering required.
We combine:

* the ability to attach callbacks whenever we want, 
* the power to create new promises by returning from `.then()`, and 
* the use of promise values to replace the original values

```js
var first = files[0], other = files[1];
var pDiffFirstOther = diff(first, other);

var firstLines = first.split('\n').length,
	otherLines = other.split('\n').length;

var pDiffLines = pDiffFirstOther.then(function(diff) { 
	return diff.split('\n'); 
});

var pResult = pDiffLines.then(function(diffLines) {
	return {
		first: firstLines, 
		second: secondLines, 
		diff: diffLines
	};
});
```

Everything is exactly the same, except that we now have promises instead of
values.

Whenever we want to do some extra sync (or async) processing on these 
promises, we unpack them with `.then()`. No need to move code around to make
it fit under the same callback.

Thats pretty great, isn't it? But [wait till you see what happens with 
errors](06-safety-of-then-exceptions.html)

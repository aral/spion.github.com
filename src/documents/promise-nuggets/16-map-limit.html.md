In the previous example we ran the [same async task on multiple items in 
series](14-map-in-series.html). Each task waited for the previous task to 
complete, then downloaded an item then extracted its name.

Sometimes we might want to run a limited number of tasks in parallel. In that
case we need to use something else.

#### Callbacks

With callbacks we need yet another utility function - async.mapLimit

```js
async.mapLimit(ids, 3, function(id, callback) {
	getFromStorage(id, function (err, res) {
		if (err) return callback(err);
		callback(null, res.name);
	})
}, function(err, results) {
	// results is an array of names
});

#### Promises

With promises we finally need a new helper function - `Promise.some` which is
provided to us by bluebird

```js
var queued = [], parallel = 3;
var namePromises = ids.map(function(id) {
    // How many items must download before fetching the next?
    // The queued, minus those running in parallel, plus one of 
    // the parallel slots.
    var mustComplete = Math.max(0, queued.length - parallel + 1);
    // when enough items are complete, queue another request for an item    
    return Promise.some(queued, mustComplete)
        .then(function() {
            var download = getItem(id);
            queued.push(download);
            return download;        
        }).then(function(item) {
            // after that new download completes, get the item's name.    
            return item.name;
        });
  });
Promise.all(namePromises).then(function(names) {
    // use all names here.
});
```

Even though the code is a bit longer, its quite clear: When enough of the 
queued items are complete, queue another download, wait for it to complete
then extract the item's name.

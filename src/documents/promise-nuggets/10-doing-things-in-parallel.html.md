One of the benefits of using node is the ability to run multiple I/O tasks
concurrently. Lets see how we can achieve that using callbacks or promises.


#### Callbacks

The most popular node module to run callback-based functions in parallel is 
[caolan's async](//github.com/caolan/async)


```js
function readTwoFiles(file1, file2, callback) {
	async.parallel([
		fs.readFile.bind(fs, file1),
		fs.readFile.bind(fs, file2),
	], callback);
}
readTwoFiles(file1, file2, function(err, files) {
	console.log(files[0], files[1]);
})
```

The callback is called with no error and an array of results after all 
operations are complete, or when the first error is encountered.

#### Promises

Bluebird and Q give you the `.all()` method which creates a new promise from 
an array of promises:

```js
function readTwoFiles(file1, file2) {
	return Bluebird.join(fs.readFileAsync(file1), 
		fs.readFileAsync(file2));
}
readTwoFiles(file1, file2).then(function(files) {
	console.log(files[0], files[1]);
})
```

The resulting promise is fulfilled when all the promises in the array are
fulfilled or is rejected with an error when the first error is encountered.

## Notes

async.parallel expects functions that take a single callback argument. 
`Function.bind` allows us to create such functions by binding some of the
arguments with predefined values. Therefore 

```js
fs.readFile.bind(fs, file1)
```

returns a function that works like this:

```js
function(callback) { fs.readFile(file1, callback); }
```
